### Briefly About Myself: ### 
I study at the BSU at the Faculty of Radiophysics. Since high school, I have always been close to subjects such as physics and mathematics. That is why, when looking for a direction after graduation, the choice fell on a faculty with a technical specialty.
  
Apart from physics and mathematics, my specialty is related to programming. This area interested me. In addition, in the modern world, it is one of the most popular. So I decided to learn a programming language like C #. However, after completing the courses from EPAM, I realized that I wanted something different.
After communicating with people from different fields, studying various programming languages, I decided to try myself as Frontend Developer.
  
I am ready to spend my free time learning something new and I believe that the field of programming, like no other, allows you to pump yourself and your skills.
